# Credit-card-Lead
### EDA on Credit card lead dataset. (Predictive model is comming in some days.)
Recently I had participated in Analytics Vidhya JobAThon May 2021 and this was the dataset I was given. This dataset has details about customers like their Customer ID, Age, Gender, Region code, Occupation, (Aquisition) Channel code, Vintage, Credit product, Average account balance, Is (customer) active (in last 3 months) and the last column Is_Lead which tells us if its a lead or not.


I have performed an Exploratory Data Analysis and noted down the insights I got about this dataset also there are some special insights that I got after feature engineering with featues such as  Age, Occupation, Region code and Channel code which you'll get to see in the file named 'Credit card lead ppt' and for details about how I did it, check the file named 'Credit card lead EDA'. 

I have also build a predictive model which can predict if a customer wants to get the Credit card or not with an accuracy of 86.13%. I removed some columns from the EDA dataset to get better results and you'll also get to know which features are important to get the better reasults. I prefred to works of some of the particenpants from the leaderbord and found Akhil krishnan's work really healpful. Because of this project I got to explore more models that I had never tried before and also got to learn about Stacking and Belnding, out of which the Stacking classifier is there in the notebook.
